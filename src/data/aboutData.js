Unlike the damsels in distress of yore, Supritha wasn't afraid of tangled code or glitchy dragons.  Armed with a trusty keyboard and a magical arsenal of languages - HTML, the eloquent storyteller; CSS, the weaver of visual wonders; and JavaScript, the mischievous prankster with a heart of gold - Supritha could breathe life into any digital canvas.",

One day, a shimmering butterfly crafted entirely of code fluttered by, its wings whispering tales of a faraway land where mobile apps roamed free.
